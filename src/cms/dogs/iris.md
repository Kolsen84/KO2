Iris is a goofy, fun loving girl who loves her toys -- especially the squeaky ones! She is always by my side, and loves to play and go on walks. She has a nightly routine where she has to pick out a toy to take to bed with her. We love this goofy girl. Iris is co-owned with Robin Thomas at [Highland Goldendoodles](http://www.highlandgoldendoodles.com/).
