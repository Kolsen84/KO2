Meet our Mama to our Mini Bernedoodles, Loli has the best temperament one could ask for, she loves kids and other dogs. She loves to be active and also loves to snuggle and watch a show. She is the best mom to her babies, very attentive and loves to play and interact as they get older. Loli is planning on having a litter with Archie this fall. These puppies will be raise with ENS and puppy culture, lots of socialization with kids and other dogs. If you are interested in adding one of these sweet babies to your family send us an email, reservations spots open
