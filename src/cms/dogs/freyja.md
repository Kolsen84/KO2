gender: f
bio: Freyja was found wandering the streets of Houston, Texas after Hurricane
  Ike. She's a dachshund/poodle mix, and had some major health complications in
  her life, eventually passing away from heart failure in 2018. She was an
  incredibly sweet dog who loved napping on or near her humans, and wagged the
  entire back half of her long body whenever human mom or dad came home. She
  would've been a terrible choice as a breeding dog, so her inclusion on this
  breeder website template is probably completely inappropriate, but her family
  loved her, and any chance to put a cute picture of Freyja out into the world
  is an opportunity that must be taken!
