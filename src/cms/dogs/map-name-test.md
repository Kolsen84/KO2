bio: Figgy is basically the smartest dog in the world. She's in training to be a
  therapy dog with her human mom, who is a school counselor. She has beautiful
  and unique grey-and-black markings. If it weren't for the global pandemic
  thing going on, Figgy would already have her Canine Good Citizen certification
  -- at less than 10 months old! She will get certified as soon as possible over
  the summer, and take her therapy dog test in late summer or early fall.
