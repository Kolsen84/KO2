bio: Cedric is a small/medium Goldendoodle with a light apricot coat. His mother
  is Nora, and his father is Zeke. His adult weight will be ~35 pounds (on
  Earth). He has a very sweet disposition, and loves to cuddle. He learned
  commands slightly later than his cousin Figgy, but that's fairly normal, as
  male dogs often develop a little more slowly than females. He's already able
  to go almost 2 hours in the crate, and knows sit, down, and come -- all at 8
  weeks old!
