All our puppies are raised in our home, they whelp in my puppy room which is across the hall from my bedroom, once the puppies eyes and ears are open they are moved to the kitchen where they are a part of all our daily living until they go home. I start ENS and ESI on day 3 of their life and continue that until day 16. They are also raised with Puppy culture and are exposed to new things daily. The vacuum and blender don't faze them. I have five kids ranging in age from 4-13 so they are very experienced with little kiddos. We spend a lot of our time giving these puppies the best start at life. Nutrition is very important in a dogs life to make sure they live the longest, healthiest life possible. I strongly recommend Paw Tree, you can learn more here Use code Intro4u to save 20% off your first order.
