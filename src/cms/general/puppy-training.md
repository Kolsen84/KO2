All our pups are raised with an enormous amount of love and care: They're whelped in the puppy room across the hall from my bedroom and are moved to the kitchen once their eyes and ears are open. They're part of my family's every day life, and become accustomed to vacuuming, mopping, dishwashers, TV’s, music, lawnmowers outside, dogs, cats, and adults and children of all ages and sizes.

I use Early Neurological Stimulation (ENS) and Puppy Culture’s Puppy Enrichment Activities with my puppies, giving them the very best start in life before they go to their furever homes.

## Early Neurological Stimulation (ENS)

In an effort to improve the performance of dogs used for military purposes, a program called “Bio Sensor” was developed. The military learned that performing early neurological stimulation exercises with puppies could have important and lasting effects. The studies showed that there are specific time periods early in life when neurological stimulation has maximum results.  The first period begins at the third day of life and lasts until the sixteenth day, because this interval of time is a period of rapid neurological growth and development.

I perform ENS with every puppy, handling them daily during that two-week window at the beginning of their lives. I go through the following exercises with each puppy every day:

* Tactile Stimulation: Holding the pup in one hand and gently tickling him or her between the toes using a Q-tip.
* Head Held Erect: Using both hands, I hold the pup upright, so that its head is directly above its tail.
* Head Pointed Down: Again using both hands, the puppy's head is reversed and pointed downward towards the ground.
* Supine Position: I hold the pup so that its back is resting in the palms of my hands with its nose facing the ceiling.
* Thermal Stimulation: I place the pup standing on a cool, damp towel.

### ENS Benefits

* Improved cardiovascular performance
* Stronger heartbeat
* Stronger adrenal glands
* More tolerance to stress
* Greater resistance to disease

I do ENS in addition to the daily love and handling each pup receives beginning the moment it is born.

## Early Scent Introduction (ESI)

Scent abilities are often very important for companion, service, and therapy dogs. To support development of these skills, I use Early Scent Introduction -- a training program for puppies designed to enhance their ability to identify, and react to, specific scents. Each day, I introduce a new scent to the puppy for brief intervals, and record the puppy's reaction as positive, negative, or neutral.

Even for dogs who won't use scent skills in their roles as adults, ESI provides early exposure to a variety of new smells, as well as great stimulation for a puppy's growing brain.
