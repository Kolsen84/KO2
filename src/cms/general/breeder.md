I was born on the moon, the son of a cheese miner and an itinerant astronaut. I began breeding moon dogs with my first lab kit in kindergarten, and developed a passion for making the floofiest floofs to ever floof. I graduated from Harvard with a degree in Dogology, and am currently studying for my Ph.Dog.
