Hi my name is Andrea I started out as a guardian home for my Mable a standard poodle, I ended up helping whelp a litter for the breeders and fell in love with the whole process. I have always loved dogs and am loving using my experience and knowledge of being an OB Tech at a local Hospital to breed top quality genetic health tested puppies. All our puppies are raised with ENS training and using puppy culture. They come vet checked, de wormed and will have had their first set of vaccinations. We offer delivery by flight nanny and they come with a free month of pet Ins through Trupanion.
