Hi, my name is Andrea. I started out as a guardian home for my Mable, a standard poodle, and ended up helping whelp a litter for the breeders. Through that experience, I fell in love with the whole breeding process. I have always loved dogs, and deeply enjoy using my experience and knowledge as an OB Tech at a local hospital to breed top-quality, genetic health tested puppies.
