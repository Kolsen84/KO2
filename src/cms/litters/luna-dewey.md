I am really excited for this pairing! Dewey is a handsome F1B Mini Bernedoodle and weighs 35 lbs. He has a silky soft and rare chocolate brown coat with light brown and white markings. He has been health and DNA tested and cleared through Embark, FF, DD, EmE, KYKY, ATAT, bb, Ssp. All their puppies will be carriers of chocolate and have amazing coats and temperaments.

Puppies arrived June 8th, 4 boys and 6 girls
