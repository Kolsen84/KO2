Cedric and Gypsy will make beautiful imaginary moon babies. They're expected in late June, and should have Cedric's sweet disposition with Gypsy's athletic prowess.

Gypsy was a national field trial champion during her competition career, and even in retirement can leap up to 30 feet off of the ground on the moon. Expect these puppies to be active!
