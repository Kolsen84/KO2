name: 'Cedric'
breed: 'Goldendoodle'
color: 'Apricot'
age: 1
sex: 'M'
bio: "Cedric used to be Regulus, and we still accidentally call him Reg a lot. We haven't met him as of this writing, but we will soon. I'm writing a lot here to see what a longer paragraph will look like on the card. Should I shorten it on the card and then make a click-through to a longer thing? I don't think so, but you know, maybe I should. Who knows. Not me. Anyway, I should actually do something useful, so I'll stop typing silliness."
